            <h2>About Ali </h2>
            <p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, was more than just a boxer. 
                He was a legend, an icon, and a symbol of resilience and determination. Often referred to as 
                "The Greatest," Ali's life and career left an indelible mark on the world.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Boxing Career</h2>
            <p>
                Ali's journey to becoming a boxing legend began at the young age of 12 when he started training at a local gym. 
                His talent was evident from the start, and by the time he was 18, he had won a gold medal in the light 
                heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics. He turned professional shortly after and quickly rose through the ranks.

            <h2>Ali's Unique Style</h2>
            <p>
                What set Ali apart from other boxers was not just his physical prowess but also his charismatic personality. 
                He had a unique style inside and outside the ring. His quick footwork, lightning-fast jabs, and innovative "rope-a-dope" strategy made him a formidable opponent. 
                Yet, it was his gift of gab, his witty rhymes, and his self-confidence that made him a superstar. 
                He famously declared, "I am the greatest," and then proceeded to prove it in the ring.

            <h2> A Force for Social Change </h2>
            <p>
                Ali's influence extended far beyond boxing. He used his fame and platform to champion civil rights and oppose the Vietnam War. 
                In 1967, he refused to be drafted into the military, citing religious and ethical reasons. This decision cost him his boxing titles and suspension from the sport. 
                However, Ali stood firm in his convictions, becoming a symbol of resistance and a voice for the marginalized.

                Ali emerged victorious in what is considered one of the greatest bouts in boxing history.
